Description: Automatically detects and enforces valid model evaluation by identifying
    information reuse between training and evaluation data. Guards against data leakage,
    look-ahead bias, and invalid cross-validation schemes that inflate performance estimates.
    Supports temporal, spatial, and grouped evaluation structures.
