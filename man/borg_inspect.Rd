\title{Inspect R Objects for Evaluation Risks}
\usage{
borg_inspect(
  object,
  train_idx = NULL,
  test_idx = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  target_col = NULL,
  spatial_cols = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An R object to inspect. Supported types include:
\itemize{
\item Preprocessing: \code{preProcess}, \code{recipe}, \code{prcomp}
\item CV objects: \code{trainControl}, \code{rsplit}, \code{vfold_cv}
\item Model objects: \code{train}, \code{lm}, \code{glm}
\item Data frames with train/test split information
}}

\item{train_idx}{Integer vector of training row indices. Required for
data-level inspection.}

\item{test_idx}{Integer vector of test row indices. Required for
data-level inspection.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame. Required when inspecting preprocessing
objects to compare parameters against train-only statistics.}

\item{target_col}{Optional name of the target/outcome column. If provided,
checks for target leakage (features highly correlated with target).}

\item{spatial_cols}{Optional character vector of coordinate column names.
If provided, checks spatial separation between train and test.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to type-specific inspectors.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{BorgRisk}} object containing:
\describe{
\item{risks}{List of detected risk objects}
\item{n_hard}{Count of hard violations}
\item{n_soft}{Count of soft inflation warnings}
\item{is_valid}{TRUE if no hard violations detected}
}
}
\description{
\code{borg_inspect()} examines R objects for signals of information reuse that
would invalidate model evaluation. It returns a structured assessment of
detected risks.
}
\details{
\code{borg_inspect()} dispatches to type-specific inspectors based on the class
of the input object. Each inspector looks for specific leakage patterns:

\describe{
\item{Preprocessing objects}{Checks if parameters (mean, sd, loadings)
were computed on data that includes test indices}
\item{CV objects}{Validates that train/test indices do not overlap and
that grouping structure is respected}
\item{Feature engineering}{Checks if encodings, embeddings, or derived
features used test data during computation}
}
}
\examples{
# Inspect a preprocessing object
data(mtcars)
train_idx <- 1:25
test_idx <- 26:32

# BAD: preProcess fitted on full data (will detect leak)
pp_bad <- scale(mtcars[, -1])

# GOOD: preProcess fitted on train only
pp_good <- scale(mtcars[train_idx, -1])
